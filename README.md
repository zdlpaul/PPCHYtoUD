This is an adapted version of the [UDConverter](https://github.com/thorunna/UDConverter) that was originally created for the [[https://linguist.is/wiki/index.php?title=Icelandic_Parsed_Historical_Corpus_(IcePaHC)][IcePaHC]].
The scripts are modified to work with the [PPCHY](https://github.com/beatrice57/penn-parsed-corpus-of-historical-yiddish).

The converter is still a WIP.
