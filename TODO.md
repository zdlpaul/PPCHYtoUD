## `rules.py`

General problem here is to get the Santorini corpus to the IcePaHC system. 
I want to implement definiteness, not sure how though, since it is not marked on the head or the phrase level in the PPHC format - I don't know where the Icelandic people got it from then tbh. 

### `head_rules = {}`
- [ ] CP-QUE-MAT-THT not implemented yet 
- [ ] -DBL constituents, maybe just delete them
- [ ] -DIAGN, talk to K about that

###  `Icepahc_feats = {}`
- [ ] implement definiteness in the `"NOUN":` subitem (How?)
